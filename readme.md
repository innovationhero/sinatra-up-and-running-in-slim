# Sinatra: Up and Running Hands On (in Slim)

Here is the incomplete (not using git module) of the hand's on  blog
project from the final chapter in
[Sinatra](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sinatra-Up-Running-Alan-Harris/dp/1449304230/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1333952881&sr=8-1)

I've chosen to implement this using [slim](http://slim-lang.org) as slim is
the template system I intend to use going forward.

The trickiest part to convert was the index page as
* blocks cannot be used and
* '-' **not** '==' should be used for any statement containing 'do'

## Helper script

A helper script _launch.rb_ has been created to start the blog:

    ruby launch.rb

to get started.
